## About Me

I am a project manager looking to become a developer! I enjoy being creative, solving problems, and collaboration. As a PM, I love being on teams as much as I do leading teams. I am also a LEAN Yellow Belt and I strive to make process improvement part of my everyday life. As I create the projects that you will see in my Portfolio, I will be aiming to write their code as simply and efficiently as possible.
